# Extension Icon

The extension currently doesn't have an icon. For a professional marketplace presence, you should add a 128x128 PNG icon.

## Creating an Icon
1. Create a 128x128 pixel PNG image
2. Use colors from your theme palette (like #80CBC4 teal, #D9D9D9 light gray)
3. Simple, recognizable design
4. Name it `icon.png`
5. Place it in the root directory
6. Add to package.json:

```json
"icon": "icon.png"
```

## Icon Ideas
- Paint palette with theme colors
- Stylized "N" for Nishuuu
- Abstract geometric shapes in theme colors
- Mountain/landscape silhouette (matching "Tara" nature theme)

Without an icon, the extension will use VS Code's default icon on the marketplace.
