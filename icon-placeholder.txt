# This is a placeholder for the extension icon
# You should replace this with an actual PNG image file named 'icon.png'
# Recommended size: 128x128 pixels
# The icon should represent the Nishuuu Themes brand

# For now, this serves as a reminder to create a proper icon
# The icon will be displayed in the VS Code Extensions panel
